             William Llewelyn "Buster" Lloyd-Jones was a British veterinary practitioner. In his early years, he developed a passion for animals. Buster contracted Polio as a young child, which affected him later in his life. As Buster grew up he was determined to become a vet. Though it meant a complete break with his father, he enrolled for training with a well-known animal society as a trainee in animal husbandry. Shortly afterwards he was appointed as lethalist to the animal dispensary at Wimbledon. Buster cared for sick, injured and abandoned animals during the Second World War. Buster was a very kind man with a passion for animals, and during the war, kept a menagerie of abandoned animals. Cats, dogs, rabbits, goats, bush babies, parrots, monkeys and even snakes, were just a few of his wartime residents at his house, Clymping Dene. <br>

In 1947, Dunlap founded the Women's Veterinary Medical Association, now known as the Association of Women Veterinarians Foundation. She wrote, "Through our organization we should offer guidance and help where it is needed, so that others will avoid our mistakes and most easily find happiness and success." Dunlap edited and contributed to Dr. Joseph Arburua's book, Narrative of Veterinary Medicine in California. She worked in the toxicology department of the University of California, San Francisco College of Medicine until poor health led to her resignation. <br>
